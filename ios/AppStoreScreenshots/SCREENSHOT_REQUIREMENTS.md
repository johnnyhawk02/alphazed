# App Store Screenshot Requirements

## Required Device Screenshots

### iPhone Screenshots (Required)
1. **iPhone 16 Pro Max** (1290 x 2796 pixels)
   - This meets the 6.5" Super Retina Display requirement
   - Available in your simulator

2. **iPhone SE (3rd generation)** 
   - While this doesn't match the 5.5" requirement exactly, you can use this for now
   - Available in your simulator
   - Before final submission, use Xcode Media Manager to generate the 5.5" iPhone 8 Plus (1242 × 2208 pixels) screenshots

### iPad Screenshots (If your app supports iPad)
1. **iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)** 
   - This meets the 12.9" iPad Pro requirement
   - Available in your simulator

2. **iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)**
   - This meets the 11" iPad Pro requirement
   - Available in your simulator

## Screenshot Naming Convention

Name your screenshots using this format:
```
{device}_{number}_{description}.png
```

Examples:
- iPhone16ProMax_1_HomeScreen.png
- iPhone16ProMax_2_Gameplay.png
- iPhone16ProMax_3_Achievement.png
- iPhoneSE_1_HomeScreen.png
- iPadPro13_1_HomeScreen.png

For App Store Connect, when you upload your screenshots, the system will automatically detect the device type based on image dimensions, regardless of filename. However, using a consistent naming convention helps you stay organized during the submission process.

## Screenshot Content Recommendations
For your educational app AlphaZed, take screenshots that showcase:
1. The main menu/home screen
2. The gameplay/learning activity
3. Any achievement or reward screens
4. Any parent/teacher settings or controls

## Taking Screenshots in Simulator
1. Launch the appropriate simulator device
2. Open your AlphaZed app
3. Navigate to the screen you want to capture
4. Take a screenshot using:
   - Command (⌘) + Shift + 4, then Space, then click on the simulator window
   - OR use the simulator menu: File > Take Screenshot

## Minimum Requirements
If you have time constraints, at minimum focus on:
1. iPhone 16 Pro Max (for the larger iPhone requirement)
2. iPad Pro 13-inch (for the iPad requirement, if your app supports iPad)
